# Info

We will have class virtually on Monday, May 2nd via the Zoom Conferencing > Course Lecture link on Canvas.
We will hold “murder sessions” for presentations that day. Feedback will involve very hard questions and minutiae, but your final grade will be based on a final video due by May 6th. The video should adapt to the feedback provided during the murder session.
Also, please do not print your posters. Simply construct them using a single PowerPoint slide which will be projected or shared.
